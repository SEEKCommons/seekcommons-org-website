## SEEKCommons Network Convening (2024)

_Welcome to the 2nd Annual SEEKCommons Research Network Convening!_

The SEEKCommons Network is bridging long-standing divides between environmental scientists, activists, FOSS technologists, and science and technology (STS) researchers by addressing common social, technical, and environmental problems. For our second year of network-building efforts, we will focus on the issue of __sustainability of Open Technologies and Open Science practices__.

The plan is to discuss the challenges and promises of the work we are doing on the topic and decide on how to allocate resources for collaborative research in 2025.

### Convening Hotel

**Hotel Shattuck Plaza Berkeley, 2086 Allston Way, Berkeley, CA 94704.**
