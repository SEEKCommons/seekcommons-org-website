## 2nd SEEKCommons Network Convening (2024)

_Welcome to the Annual Socio-Environmental Knowledge Commons Research Network Convening!_

The SEEKCommons project is working to bridge the long-standing divides between environmental scientists, activists, FOSS technologists, and science and technology (STS) researchers to address and redress pressing social, technical, and environmental problems. For our second year of network-building activities, we will explore the __sustainability of Open Technologies and Open Science practices__.

The plan is to discuss the challenges and promises of the work we are doing on socio-technical and environmental problems and decide on how to allocate our resources for advancing collaborative research on the socio-environmental commons for 2025.
