## U.S. NSF SEEKCommons Network Convening (2024)

_Welcome to the 2nd Annual Research Network Convening!_

The NSF SEEKCommons Network is bridging long-standing divides between environmental scientists, community organizers, FOSS technologists, and science and technology (STS) researchers by addressing common social, technical, and environmental problems. For our second year of network-building efforts, we will focus on the issue of __sustainability of Open Technologies and Open Science practices__.

The plan is to discuss the challenges of the work we are doing on the topic and decide on how to allocate resources for collaborative research in 2025. We will also prepare an inventory of "patterns" and "anti-patterns" that we observed in our experiences with Open Science and Socio-Environmental research.
