### Partnership SEEKCommons + Open Source Hardware Association 

This year we are reserving one fellowship slot to the topic of "open hardware sustainability" in partnership with the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org)!

The Open Source Hardware Association (OSWA), Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering technological knowledge and encouraging research that is accessible, collaborative and respects user freedom. OSHWA's primary activities include hosting the annual Open Hardware Summit and maintaining the Open Source Hardware certification, which allows the community to quickly identify and represent hardware that complies with the community definition of open source hardware.

#### Research Topics

We welcome Fellowship applications on the sustainability of Open Source Hardware (OSHW). The goal of the partnership between SEEKCommons and OSHWA is to promote a culture of collaboration between environmental scientists, activists, and open hardware technologists to create more sustainable open research infrastructures.

We would like to support applications that address one (or more) of these questions:
- What are the main issues of sustainability in Open Source Hardware? How can we respond to these issues as a community?
- How can we promote a culture of Open Source Hardware development and sharing in academia? How can we promote open hardware instrumentation in socio-environmental research?
- What is the state-of-the-art in Open Source Hardware documentation and how can we improve it?
- How can we decrease the energy requirements of digital infrastructures and drive the adoption of renewable energy sources with Open Source Hardware?
