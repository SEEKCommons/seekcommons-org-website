What can Open Science (OS) contribute to the present and future of socio-environmental research and knowledge dissemination? Why is this question worth pursuing through a distributed network of STS researchers, OS practitioners, and socio-environmental researchers working with climate-impacted communities?

In order to address these questions, the “Socio-Environmental Knowledge Commons” (SEEKCommons) project will create and consolidate a network dedicated to building pathways for horizontal collaborations. Bio- and geo-physical studies of environmental dynamics have traditionally been siloed from social research. To create conditions for meaningful interdisciplinarity around social and environmental action, socio-environmental research projects will provide concrete data problems and datasets to be curated, documented, and widely shared with OS tools, while providing novel contexts to apply OS principles. Expert OS practitioners will contribute tools, methodologies, and ethical guidance on FAIR principles that, when translated and adapted to socio-environmental action research, can be well-understood and effectively used by community partners. STS research will provide translation and mediation between OS and socio-environmental action research groups to support community-based research. Here are the activities we will conduct:

* STS Research: Conduct empirical research on the current state of "Open Science" projects in the context of socio-environmental research. This is one of the key components of the project that will inform all the activities for the upcoming years of the project.

* Network Convenings: Regular virtual and in-person convenings will bring together network members, fellows, and guests to share research findings and challenges, as well as build consensus on how to advance open and collaborative work.

* Fellowships: Undergraduate and graduate student fellowships will support the integration of open science practices in community-oriented environmental and climate action research.

* Data Facilitators Consortium: The DFC will build network capacity to take on needed translational and facilitation skills, developing and modeling ways researchers can work in partnership with communities. We will explore and rethink conventional models for training and pedagogy to center community perspectives and priorities, and support dialogue and multi-directional knowledge sharing.

* Resource Hub: This open and editable hub will house tools, resources, and curricular modules for integrating FAIR, CARE, and other open science principles into participatory socio-environmental research.

SEEKCommons is a collaboration between partners at the University of Notre Dame, the Open Environmental Data Project, and the HDF Group. 

The project is made possible by a National Science Foundation [FAIROS RCN grant (Award 2226425)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226425&HistoricalAwards=false). This award was jointly supported by the NSF Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.
