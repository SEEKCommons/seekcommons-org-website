What can Open Science (OS) contribute to the present and future of socio-environmental research? Why is this question worth pursuing through a distributed network of STS researchers, Open Science practitioners, and socio-environmental researchers working with climate-impacted communities?

In order to address these questions, the “Socio-Environmental Knowledge Commons” (SEEKCommons) project will study and help promote the "common" in science and technology with an emphasis on collaborative socio-environmental research. Traditionally, bio- and geo-physical studies of environmental dynamics have been siloed from social research. To create conditions for meaningful interdisciplinarity around social and environmental action, socio-environmental researchers will provide concrete data problems to be curated, documented, and shared with common tools, while providing novel contexts to apply participatory research principles. Open Science practitioners will contribute common tools, methodologies, and ethical guidance on FAIR principles that, when translated and adapted to socio-environmental action, can be effectively used by community partners. STS researchers will provide translation and mediation across OS and socio-environmental action to support community-based research. 

Here are the activities we are conducting as a research network:

* STS Research: Empirical research on the current state of "Open Science" projects in socio-environmental research. This is one of the key components of the project that will inform all the activities for the upcoming years of the project.

* Network Convenings: Regular virtual and in-person convenings will bring together network members, fellows, and guest speakers to share research findings and challenges, as well as build consensus on how to advance common technologies and collaborative work.

* Fellowships: Undergraduate and graduate student fellowships are offered to support the integration of open science practices in community-oriented environmental and climate action research.

* SEEKCommons Hub: This open and editable hub will house tools, resources, and curricular modules for integrating data stewardship frameworks into participatory socio-environmental research.

SEEKCommons is a collaboration between the University of Notre Dame, University of Michigan, University of Virginia, and the HDF Group. 

The project is made possible by a National Science Foundation [FAIROS RCN grant (Award 2226425)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226425&HistoricalAwards=false). This award was jointly supported by the NSF Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.
