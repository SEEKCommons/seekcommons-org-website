				    <h3>State of Open Science in Socioenvironmental Research</h3>
				</header>
				    <p>One of the core components of the SEEKCommons project consists in STS research about the development, use, and debate about Open Science in the context of socioenvironmental research and action. This activity involves our core team of researchers, but also the wider network of STS partners we convened. For this research activity, we have prepared conference panels,	presentations, publications, and open data sets to be shared with our Network. For 2025, we will organize a volume that combines what we have learned from the RCN about the challenges and good practices of fostering common socio-environmental projects.

					<h3>Research Network Convenings</h3>
				</header>
				<p>We organize virtual and in-person convenings regularly to bring together Network members and Fellows to share research findings and challenges, as well as build social ties to conduct collaborative research. <a href="https://seekcommons.org/in-person-convenings.html">Click here for more information about our annual in-person convenings</a> and <a href="https://seekcommons.org/community-calls.html">here to access the agenda for our public Community Calls</a>.

				<h3><a href = "https://seekcommons.org/fellowship-application.html">SEEKCommons Fellowships</a></h3>
				</header>
				<p>The SEEKCommons <a href = "https://seekcommons.org/fellowship-application.html">Fellowship</a> brings together graduate students and early-career researchers with new perspectives and voices to socio-environmental research with open technologies. The Fellowship program is designed to encourage new integrative practices involving environmental and climate action research with OS practices, and provide a space for fellows and network members to connect on research issues, challenges, and solutions. For more information on how to apply, please click <a href = "https://seekcommons.org/fellowship-application.html">here</a>.

                </header>
                <p>Our Hub hosts references to research tools, resources, and curricular modules on the participatory governance of socio-environmental projects. We have worked to document and deposit research outputs from our Network members on Wikidata (to increase their findability). We have also created a module of Gala (the sustainability education platform) to access the linked data we curated. The ultimate goal of our Hub is to provide easy access to all the research outputs of our Network in a way that is well-aligned with the goals of data management and stewardship that we can find in FAIR/CARE/Commons principles.
