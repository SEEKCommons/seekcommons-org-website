                            <p>Insha Bint Bashir (she/her) is a PhD student in Anthropology at the University of Notre Dame. Her research explores the intersection of digital surveillance, misinformation, and the erasure of archives in contexts of political conflict and settler colonialism. As a research fellow with the SEEKCommons project, Insha studies data protection and security, analyzes debates surrounding digital technologies for data sharing and protection, particularly in communities facing environmental and political challenges. She also curates the project’s public library and examines literature on issues such as CARE principles, data sovereignty, open tech, and community-based research. Through her work with SEEKCommons, Insha aims to integrate anthropological perspectives on power dynamics and local knowledge into open science practices for environmental action.</p>
