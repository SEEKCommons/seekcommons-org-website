					<h3>Rebecca Hardin</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
                Trained as an environmental anthropologist, Hardin works at the intersection of Environmental and Digital Justice, leading an open source, open access learning environment named Gala. Her digital and environmental work engages in knowledge partnerships and collaborative research in South Africa, France, Ethiopia, Kenya, Gabon, the U.S. and Canada. Hardin works in teams of researchers from engineering to ecology and epidemiology, making innovations more inclusive, communications more effective, and education more collaborative. Hardin serves as Co-PI of the SEEKCommons project, where she is responsible for integrating the Gala platform with the SEEKCommons Resource Hub to enable more FAIR and CAREful knowledge practices, supporting non-academic knowledge bearers' priorities and perspectives in addressing health, climate, food, energy and water challenges.

                Sarah Rebolloso McCullough creates meaningful and respectful dialogue across boundaries that typically divide—between universities and communities, activists and researchers, scientists and humanists, workers and policymakers. An expert in research culture and a seasoned connector, McCullough’s work is focused on promoting equity-based solutions to social problems. She has published on equity in bicycling, community engagement, and an assessment of transportation equity efforts in California. Her newest project studies the origins of mobility justice within a multiracial collective called the Untokening. She serves as Co-PI of the SEEKCommons project, where she contributes to the design and development of the Fellowship program.

                                Mayra Sánchez Barba works as the Research Program & Policy Manager at the UC Davis Feminist Research Institute. In this role, she is committed to developing more just and transformative research by working collaboratively with researchers and community members to center marginalized standpoints and unsettle dominant stories. She completed her PhD in Geography with a DE in Feminist Theory and Research Methods. Her scholarship has focused on the politics of knowledge in the making of toxic social and environmental disparities, and the ethics of everyday care work. This work draws from feminist theory, critical race theory, geographies of environmental justice, critical disability studies, and environmental humanities. More recently, she is interested in learning how we collectively cope with loss, and is inspired by indigenous knowledge and ecological science that center our interconnectedness to seek ways of living that nourish our ecologies and cultivate more livable worlds.</p>

                            <p>Insha Bint Bashir (she/her) is a PhD student in Anthropology at the University of Notre Dame. Her research explores the intersection of digital surveillance, misinformation, and the erasure of archives in contexts of political conflict and settler colonialism. As a research fellow with the SEEKCommons project, Insha studies data protection and security, analyzes debates surrounding digital technologies for data sharing and protection, particularly in communities facing environmental and political challenges. She also curates the project’s public library and examines literature on issues such as CARE principles, data sovereignty, open tech, and community-based research. Through her work with SEEKCommons, Insha aims to integrate anthropological perspectives on power dynamics and local knowledge into open science practices for environmental action.</p>
