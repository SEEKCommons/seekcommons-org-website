The “Socio-environmental Knowledge Commons” (SEEKCommons) project is dedicated to research and development of open technologies and methodologies to help advance socio-environmental action. We aim primarily for creating bridges across domains of expertise through regular activities of community-building and skill-and-resource sharing of socio-environmental research products as common goods. In order to achieve this goal, we will draw from Science and Technology Studies (STS) for the study of “Open Science,” but also from the “Open Science” research and development practices to help advance the adoption of FAIR and CARE stewardship principles in the socio-environmental action research community.
