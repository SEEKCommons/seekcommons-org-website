## About SEEKCommons

The Socio-Environmental Knowledge Commons (SEEKCommons) project is dedicated to building pathways for horizontal collaborations across Science and Technology Studies (STS), Open Science (OS), and socio-environmental researchers and community organizers.

The SEEKCommons Fellowship is an initiative to bring graduate students and early-career researchers to socio-environmental research with common technologies. Our program is designed to:

- Encourage new integrative practices involving socio-environmental and climate action research with OS practices; and
- Provide a space for fellows and network members to collaborate on common research tools, issues, and challenges.

We are seeking 9 fellows for the 2025 SEEKCommons Fellowship. More details below:
